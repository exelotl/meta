# Contributing

These base guidelines (if not specified otherwise) apply to every repository under the **gbdev** github organisation. Additionally the specific CONTRIBUTING rules of the repository in object apply. In case of conflicts, those last ones have the priority.

## General

- In case you are unsure, you can reach out the maintainers on [Discord, IRC or Matrix](https://gbdev.io/chat.html)

## Issues

- Provide an example to reproduce the problem in isolation. This should include no private code. The example should be self-runnable. If a snippet is too small, create a repository.
- Unless the problem is visual, do not include screenshots. They are not helpful.
- Please be patient. You are probably frustrated by your problem - the maintainers are likely not aware of your workflow.
- Be grateful for any help you are getting and follow through. The maintainers are likely giving you support for free.

## Pull Requests

- Keep titles and commit messages brief and concise.
- If the PR is not self-explanatory, add brief description of what has been done and implementation choices (if any).
- Keep the work in the branch focused and directed at accomplishing *only* what you are describing in the PR. Ideally a PR should address a single issue (or a set of assimilable ones).
