This repository keeps track of community wide configurations
of our infrastructure
that generally don't fit the other repositories.

Documented:

- IRC <-> Discord bridge 
- GitHub events -> Discord (webhooks)

Undocumented but active:

- Discord <-> Matrix bridge
- Patreon integrations and notifications

Work in progress:

- Open Collective integrations and notifications
- Money donation history and balance (script to aggregate?)
